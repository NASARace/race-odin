            <h1 id="why-is-odin-fire-open-sourced" class="title">Why is ODIN-fire Open Sourced</h1>
            <p>There are three types of stakeholder categories</p>
            <ul>
              <li>agencies (fire, land management, local/state/federal government etc.)</li>
              <li>research organizations</li>
              <li>companies with wildland fire related products and services</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This means the stakeholder community is larger than &quot;just&quot; fire agencies, of which there already are hundreds. The goal is
            to provide some common ground for the whole stakeholder community with a low barrier of entry for everybody.</p>
            <p><img class="center scale60" src="images/odin-open.svg" alt="RACE overview"></p>
            <p>This does not mean that all applications built with ODIN-fire have to be public, and it especially does not mean that
            ODIN-fire based components developed by 3rd parties (e.g. vendors) have to be open sourced. ODIN-fire (like the rest of <a href="http://nasarace.github.io/race/">RACE</a>)
            is published under <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache_License_v2</a> and hence supports to develop closed, commercial software on top of it.</p>
            <p>The goal is that no stakeholder has to develop from scratch, and that - from a technical point of view - new 3rd party 
            components/services can easily be integrated by other stakeholders. To that end ODIN-fire itself is open sourced and royalty free.</p>
            <p>Of course every individual or organization that wants to add to the public basis is more than welcome to become an
            ODIN-fire contributor. Our ultimate goal is a synergetic community to tackle the increasingly hard problem of wildland fire management.</p>
