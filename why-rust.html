            <h1 id="why-is-odin-ported-to-rust" class="title">Why is ODIN ported to Rust</h1>
            <p>As of 12/2023 we have started to port the ODIN server infrastructure to Rust. This became necessary
            because our focus has shifted from RACEs original goal of building a Java-based prototyping environment for 
            distributed simulations to ODINs goal of supporting field-deployable production servers that also utilize external 
            native libraries and applications. In other words ODIN (as an application domain) is now the focus, not the
            underlying library to implement it. The main design principle stays the same: using actors to create scalable
            concurrent systems.</p>
            <p>Although RACE was cross-platform (because of its pure Java use) it was originally supposed to run on dedicated
            machines with respective admin support. Installation requires to build from sources, which means there are several
            prerequisites (recent JDK version, Git, SBT build system, local RACE repository clone). </p>
            <p>ODIN servers on the other hand will have to run on machines that do not require <em>build-from-source</em> installation and might
            not have the computational resources of a Java production server. ODIN applications also make use of existing external
            native software, i.e. they are <em>not</em> pure Java. This means the original build-from-source / all-batteries-included approach
            of RACE is not applicable anymore.</p>
            <p>There are additional reasons for porting ODIN. RACE was heavily based on the excellent <a href="https://akka.io/">Akka</a> library 
            for its actor system implementation. As of 09/2022 <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/">Lightbend</a> - the owner of Akka - has 
            moved from Apache to a proprietary license. While ODIN as an open source project could have been exempt the same
            is not necessarily true for ODIN&#39;s user community, which includes companies and universities. For this reason ODIN got
            stuck with Akka &lt; 2.7, which means there also was a delay in critical patches.</p>
            <p>Lastly, RACE was using Scala 2.3. In order to stay abreast with latest versions of major dependencies we would have
            had to port RACE to Scala 3. For all these reasons change was inevitable.</p>
            <p>Our solution is twofold:</p>
            <p>(1) port to a native programming environment with good cross-platform support and a rich eco-system for server
            implementation. <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> has proven itself as a very suitable choice. The capability to
            produce single file, statically linked applications that can safely use the huge eco-system of Rust crates
            and incorporate native C/C++ libraries is invaluable. We can also significantly reduce runtime cost (both memory
            and CPU) of ODIN applications.</p>
            <p>(2) move functions that are not easy to build for/run on ODIN stakeholder machines to dedicated Rust-based edge servers
            that make use of the same infrastructure we create for (1). This means we build new edge servers that replace
            external ones such as <a href="https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090">dump1090</a> (for ADS-B tracking), and add new ones for
            functions that are more ODIN specific (e.g. for <a href="https://www.firelab.org/project/windninja">WindNinja</a> micro grid wind
            integration), all from the same programming environment/build system. These servers will enjoy the same easy
            deployment we gain from (1).</p>
            <p>This porting effort is now well under way and sources are gradually showing up in the RACE repository. We expect to have
            first examples around 03/2024. Please contact <code>peter.c.mehlitz@nasa.gov</code> if you have questions regarding the ODIN
            Rust version.</p>
