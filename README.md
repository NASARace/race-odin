## RACE-ODIN

The purpose of this project is to show how to build Open Data Integration (ODIN) applications with 
[RACE](http://nasarace.github.io/race/). It specifically serves as a template to demonstrate how to add components 
(actors and supporting code) outside of the RACE code base. 

More information is available on the [RACE-ODIN website](http://NASARace.github.io/race-odin). This site also
contains detailed documentation of how to build and run RACE-ODIN and included demo applications.
