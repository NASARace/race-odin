Presentations
=============

Each presentation is contained in a single HTML file (linked below) that can be navigated with the following commands

* ⟨enter⟩ - next slide
* ⟨shift-enter⟩ - previous slide
* 'f' - enter full screen (presentation) mode (exit is browser specific, usually <esc>)
* ⟨digit⟩ - go to page 0..9 ('0' being title page)
* ⟨ctrl-digit⟩⟨digit⟩ - go to pages > 10

You might have to resize your browser into landscape format if slide pagination is off.
